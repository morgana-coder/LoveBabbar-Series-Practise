Lecture 31-41
What is Recursion?
According to book -> A function calling itself is a Recursion.
Love Babbar bhaiya explanation -> biggerproblem = something * smallerproblem (operation can be anything)

Components of Recursion :
1.Base condition with some return 
2.Recursive Function 
3. Processing Part such as printing or updation

Why Base condition required ?
Stack Overflow se bachne ke liye , it will throw Segmentation fault


Types of Recursion :
Head Recursion and Tail Recursion

jisme Recursive function end me ata hai voh Tail
jisme Recursive function pehle ata hai voh head wrt Processing Part

Tree structure of recursion is important
